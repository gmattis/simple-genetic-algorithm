# Simple-genetic-algorithm
A simple genetic algorithm inspired by NEAT  
Contrary to NEAT-Python, you must define a maximum number of neurons for the neural networks

### How to use it
Take a look at the examples in the `examples` directory. There are an example of implementation for the XOR gate, and an example with the CartPole Gym environment.  
Parameters are located in `sga/config.py`. You can edit them there or import the file in your code and set the parameters from there (take a look at the cartpole example)
