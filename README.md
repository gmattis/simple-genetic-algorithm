# Simple-genetic-algorithm
A simple genetic algorithm inspired by NEAT  
Contrary to NEAT-Python, you must define a maximum number of neurons for the neural networks

### How to use it
Take a look at the examples in the `examples` directory. There are examples of implementation for the XOR gate, and the CartPole and BipedalWalker Gym environments.  
Parameters are stored in a configuration file, and imported with the Config class. Take a look a the CartPole and BipedalWalker examples to see how to use them
